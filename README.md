# digit-rec-snn
This repo is for a spiking neural network, written with Python 3 and Jupyter, designed for predicting the associated number for 64x64 images of handwritten digits. The first file goes over the basic design of our SNN with use of the LIF model, while the second implements that design for the practical purpose of classification.
